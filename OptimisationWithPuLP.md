# Optimisation with PuLP #

## Getting Started ##
Now you know how to use this wiki, you can begin learning Python and using PuLP by looking at the content below. We recommend that you read The Optimisation Process, Optimisation Concepts, the Introduction to Python and the Introduction to PuLP before beginning the case-studies. The full PuLP function documentation is available here, and the useful functions will be explained in the case studies. The case studies are in order, so the later case studies will assume you have (at least) read the earlier case studies. However, we will provide links to any relevant information you will need.
